Description: Pipeline for performing Multi-trait ensemble genomic selection for crop breeding inbred lines. QC and clean SNP marker data, cross validate prediction accuracy for several base prediction models and multi-trait ensembles. Predictions can be made for new genotypes with SNP marker data and multi-trait selection indices can be visualised.
